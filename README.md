**TrueInvis** is a Minecraft Fabric mod that improves invisibility mechanics by hiding players' equipment from others while allowing players with the **True Sight** enchantment to see invisible players fully. The mod uses packet-based updates for optimized performance and dynamic observer tracking.

## Features

- Fully hides equipment of invisible players for normal observers.
- Introduces the **True Sight** enchantment:
  - Players wearing a helmet with True Sight can see invisible players with their equipment.
  - Invisible players are outlined with a glowing effect for True Sight observers.
- Efficient network handling:
  - Updates every 10 ticks instead of every tick.
  - Periodic resending of outlines to prevent desync.
- Works with invisibility from both potion effects and invisible flags.
- Automatic cleanup on player disconnect to prevent memory leaks.
